# Semi-Empirical Binding Energy Fitting Problem

The goal of this NCSU PY 506 assignment was to use the provided data (BE-per-nucleon data) to fit the semi-empirical binding energy formula to estimate the constants, given by
\begin{align}
    B & = a_vA - a_sA^{2/3} - a_CZ(Z-1)A^{-1/3} - a_{symm}(A-2Z)^2/A
\end{align}

Attached is the BE-per-nucleon data required to run the fitting test. Read the file from your preferred directory to run the test.

columns 1 - 6 of data file:
Mass number, number of protons, name of isotope, mass [MeV/c^2],
binding energy [MeV], binding energy per nucleus [MeV]
